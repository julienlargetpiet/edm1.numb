\usage{
fold_rec2(xmax, xmin = 1, pathc = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{xmax}{is the depth value}

\item{xmin}{is the minimum value of depth}

\item{pathc}{is the reference path, from which depth value is equal to 1}
}
\description{
Allow to find the directories and the subdirectories with a specified end and start depth value from a path. This function might be more powerfull than file_rec because it uses a custom algorythm that does not nee to perform a full recursive search before tuning it to only find the directories with a good value of depth. Depth example: if i have dir/dir2/dir3, dir/dir2b/dir3b, i have a depth equal to 3
